<h2>DatapackageProxy?</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://data.okfn.org/standards/data-package">DataPackages</a> are a nice and
neat tool to work with and bundle Data. However, working with them in
browser-based apps is not straight forward. People's hosting doesn't
support <a href="http://enable-cors.org">CORS</a> so including datapackag files using
e.g. d3.csv does not work :/. <b>Datapackageproxy</b> to the rescue!

DatapackageProxy is a appengine based script, that takes a datapackage url
(without the trailing /datapackage.json) and allows you to access it's
resources.

e.g:

<pre>
http://datapackageproxy.appengine.com/resources?n=0&url=http://data.okfn.org/data/bond-yields-uk-10y
</pre>

shows the first resource in the datapackage. If you're not sure which
resource to use, try:

<pre>
http://datapackageproxy.appengine.com/metadata?url=http://data.okfn.org/data/bond-yields-uk-10y
</pre>

This will return the metadata for the package.
